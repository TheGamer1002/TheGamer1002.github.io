  These were all made with my own platform, Clip Store.
  
  <a href="Clip.Store.mobileconfig">Get it here to make your own sites!</a>
  <br>
  <p>To install these, you just tap on the site you want as an app, then allow the download. Go to Settings, wait a few seconds, and then tap Profile Downloaded. You can look at the profile and what it contains. After that, hit Install, enter your password (we won't look!), and hit Install twice.</p>
  <br>
  <p>To uninstall it, you just need to remove it like any other app. If you want to fully get rid of it, go to Settings -> General (scroll down) -> Device Management -> (profile) -> Remove Profile and confirm. That's it!</p>
